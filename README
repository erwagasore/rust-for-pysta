* Rust for Pysta
  This is my attempt to learn and devise a mechanism of learning by the closest previous language.
  Learning is like walking. We observe, we try, we strumble and gradually master.
  This model is centred on the stage of observing, familiality is the lingua-franca.

  Learning from this methodology has assumptions, knowing at-least one programming language.
  The base programming language is going to be Python. Potentially in the future we can have other.
